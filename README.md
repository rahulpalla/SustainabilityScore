# SustainabilityScore
Sustainability Score Project
A simple program that utilizes scanners to read a country's environmental factors such as renewable electricity percentage, carbon emissions (millions of metric tons), and recycle rate percentage in order to calculate a "Sustainability Score" out of 50. The lower the score, the more suggestions it gives while the higher the score, the less suggestions/more compliments it gives.
